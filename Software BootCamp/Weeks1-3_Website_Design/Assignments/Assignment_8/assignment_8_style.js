// class challenge averages


// There are two teams, Nets and Knicks.They compete against each other 3 times.
// The team with the highest average score wins a trophy!

// Your tasks:
// 1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below

// 2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition,
// and print it to the console.Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that
// as well(draw means they have the same average score)

// 3. Bonus 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule, a
// team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a
// score of at least 100 points.Hint: Use a logical operator to test for minimum
// score, as well as multiple else -if blocks.
// 4. Bonus 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when
// both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100
// points.Otherwise, no team wins the trophy
// Test data:
// ยง Data 1: Nets score 96, 108 and 89. Knicks score 88, 91 and 110

// ยง Data Bonus 1: Nets score 97, 112 and 101. Knicks score 109, 95 and 123
// ยง Data Bonus 2: Nets score 97, 112 and 101. Knicks score 109, 95 and 106
